# nerosdk
An SDK to easily create and deploy AI agents.

## Overview
The `nerosdk` is designed to revolutionize the development and deployment of AI agents, particularly Autonomous Crypto Agents (ACAs). It leverages decentralized infrastructure, distributed computing, and blockchain-based governance to ensure scalability, transparency, and trust. By integrating open-source large language models (LLMs) and decentralized GPU networks, `nerosdk` empowers developers to create agents that operate efficiently and autonomously in decentralized ecosystems.

Key Features:
- **Distributed Compute Networks**: Removes single points of failure, providing fault tolerance and censorship resistance.
- **Open Governance**: Uses Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for transparent, community-driven decision-making.
- **Enhanced On-Chain Capabilities**: Enables autonomous financial interactions and real-time market engagement.
- **Verifiable Inference**: Integrates zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable and auditable agent outputs.

## TODO
- [ ] Create detailed documentation.
- [ ] Implement configuration-based setup for `nerosdk`.
- [ ] Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- [ ] Develop plugins for Telegram and Discord bots.
- [ ] Enable agents with wallets for autonomous transactions.
- [ ] Write comprehensive test cases.
- [ ] Create Docker images for streamlined deployment.

## Key Innovations
### Decentralized Architecture

The `nerosdk` adopts a decentralized infrastructure that distributes computational workloads across a global GPU network. This approach eliminates centralization risks such as single points of failure, censorship, and resource inequity.

### Trust and Transparency
- **Censorship Resistance**: Open-source, censorship-resistant LLMs ensure unfiltered agent expression.
- **Verifiable Outputs**: Zero-knowledge proofs validate agent actions, enhancing accountability.

### Community Governance
The SDK integrates with DAOs, allowing stakeholders to:
- Vote on agent behavior updates.
- Decide on roadmap priorities.
- Shape the development of AI capabilities.

### Advanced Financial Integration
Agents can autonomously interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to:
- Create and manage liquidity pools.
- Execute token trades.
- Implement dynamic yield farming strategies.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1
- Finalize system architecture and specifications.
- Deploy alpha versions of governance contracts.

### Phase 2
- Integrate decentralized GPU networks for distributed inference.
- Partner with existing ACAs for compatibility testing.

### Phase 3
- Collaborate with DAOs to refine governance processes.
- Trial advanced features like model parameter tuning.

### Phase 4
- Optimize resource allocation and developer tools.
- Expand partnerships with GPU providers and additional DAOs.

## How to Start Locally
To set up the `nerosdk` locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerobossai/nerosdk
cd nerosdk
cp env.example .env  # Update the .env file with your configurations
npm install
npm start
```
